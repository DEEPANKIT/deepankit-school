
/*define a superclass Product to store the details of a product sold by a wholesaler to a retailer. Define a subclass Sales to compute the total amount paid by the retailer with or without fine along with service tax.
Some of the members of both classes are given below:
Class name: Product
Data members/instance variables:
name: stores the name of the product
code: integer to store the product code
amount: stores the total sale amount of the product (in decimals)
Member functions/methods:
Product (String n, int c, double p): parameterized constructor to assign data members: name = n, code = c and amount = p
void show(): displays the details of the data members
Class name: Sales
Data members/instance variables:
day: stores number of days taken to pay the sale amount
tax: to store the sen ice tax (in decimals)
totamt: to store the total amount (in decimals)
Member functions/methods:
Sales(â€¦.): parameterized constructor to assign values to data members of both the classes
void compute(): calculates the service tax @ 12.4% of the actual sale amount
calculates the fine @ 2.5% of the actual sale amount only if the amount paid by the retailer to the wholesaler exceeds 30 days calculates the total amount paid by the retailer as (actual sale amount + service tax + fine)
void show (): displays the data members of the superclass and the total amount
main(): inputs required data and prints the total amount
